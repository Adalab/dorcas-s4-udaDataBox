# Uda Data Box

Data React component of Urban Data Analytics.
It is a container that will have the values obtained for the following text literals:
- Price calculated by the system (uDA value).
- Algorithm used for calculation (Method).
- Accuracy of the algorithm (Accuracy).
- Average neighborhood price (uDA Typology / Neighborhood).
- Average price of the city (uDA City).

They are values brought in the answers to the calls to the API.

You can receive the coordinates to other UDA components (Uda Search Box: https://github.com/urbandataanalytics/udaSearchBox)  or external components.
